# Igitari
*A kindly powerful Git companion* (formerly known as 'Git-env')

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project currently only focuses and maintained on mono-master branch. (I see no reason to modularise it further yet.)

> **Igitari is currently not actively developed, but will be maintained.** Look at [Feature Requests](#feature-requests).

## Feature Requests

Igitari is currently feature-complete for its core goals. If you have ideas for new features:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Open an issue** describing:
   - The problem you're trying to solve
   - Your current workflow that's painful
   - How the feature would help
3. **👍 React to existing requests** you'd find useful

Features are prioritized by:
- Real-world pain points (not theoretical nice-to-haves)
- Alignment with Igitari's philosophy of being more as a helper than a wrapper
- Complexity vs. benefit tradeoff

**Note:** Igitari stays lightweight and focused. Features that introduce heavy dependencies, platform-specific APIs (GitHub/GitLab), or significant hidden complexity are likely out of scope.

Final decisions are made by the maintainer, and may take personal interest and available time into account.

Pull requests are welcomed too!

## Introduction
Igitari is a Git shell companion born from the simple desire to type 'git' less often. It's designed to make Git approachable without sacrificing its power — because you shouldn't have to fight your tools to do great work.

Written in Bash from scratch, Igitari tries to avoid as many dependencies as possible. It is lightweight, portable, and flexible, with a philosophy of being "kindly powerful": helping you explore Git's capabilities while watching your back.

This project is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.

## Philosophy: Kindly Powerful
Igitari aims to:
- **Reduce friction** in daily Git workflows
- **Provide safety nets** for common pitfalls
- **Stay out of your way** when you know what you're doing
- **Remain lightweight and modular** in its internal design
- **Rely on as few required dependencies as possible**

## Features
- Interactive Git shell with intelligent tab completion
- Dynamic prompt:
  - Branch name
  - Repository status
  - Dirty state markers
- Shell command execution (prefix with `>`)
- Operator support (`&&`, `||`, `;`)
- LazyGit integration (Ctrl+G when available)
- Web repository opening (`openweb` command)
- ~~Self-updating system~~ (Currently unmaintained due to small user base)
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL)

> [!WARNING]
> Igitari is primarily tested on Linux.
> Behavior on other platforms may vary—please report issues if you encounter discrepancies.

Upon entering, you'll see:
```
Entering Igitari (Hi!). Press Ctrl+D or type 'exit' to quit.
Prefix commands with '>' to execute shell commands
Press Ctrl+G to launch LazyGit

[.../awesome-repo/ (master*)]igitari>
```

The prompt shows:
- Repository path (compressed for readability)
- Current branch
- Status markers: `*` (unstaged), `^` (staged), `_` (stash exists)

### Basic Usage
Run Git commands without typing `git`:
```
[.../awesome-repo/ (master)]igitari> status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Run shell commands (prefix with `>`):
```
[.../awesome-repo/ (master)]igitari> > ls
README.md  package.json  src/
```

Open repository in browser:
```
[.../awesome-repo/ (master)]igitari> openweb origin
Opened: https://github.com/user/repo
```

### Operator Support
```
[.../awesome-repo/ (master)]igitari> status && > ls -la
[.../awesome-repo/ (master)]igitari> add . || echo "Failed to add files"
```
